Whooz Project:

Basically Whooz is an event manager application.
To use whooz one need to log in with a Facebook account.
We use facebook to make the registration process easier and for gathering basic information about our clients.

--CONSEPT--
Whooz has three main goals, that correspond to three main screens :
-Bringing you all the events around you (in radius of 2 km),
 that other people created using the application (Look Around screen).
-Letting you see distant Events and future events(What's Next Screen).
- Letting you create your own event (Create Event)

In addition Whooz has an navigation drawer that can be opened by swiping from the 
left side of the screen. In the nav. drawer one can quickly switch between the app screens,
open the personal area, and log out.

we will explain each screen shortly:
--Look Around--
This screen shows a list of all the events that occurs now, in radius of 2km from the user's current GPS location.
In addition, if the user is within a radius of 200m from the event, a check in button will be visible. after clicking
on it, it will be visible to all that that person is taking part in the event.
Every event has a deadline of 12 hours from the moment it starts. After that, the event is deleted(if not done so before by the event's owner).
clicking on an event will open the corresponding "Event Page"(description later).

--What's Next--
In this screen, one could find all the events that doesn't show up in the "Look Around" screen.
Meaning all the events that are distant then 2km or occur in the future.
clicking on an event will open the corresponding "Event Page"(description later).

--Create Event--
In this screen one can create his own screen using the following fields:
*photo - tapping on the cover photo will allow the user to choose a photo for the event
*Title - the event's name (mandatory)
*location - the location of the event. the user can choose a location using two different methods:
            using google location (by start typing the address) or facebook places (clicking on the facebook places
            icon we load a list of nearby places from facebook's places data base). (mandatory)
*event type - public or private. private events will be visible only to invited members.(mandatory)
*time and date - the time and date of the event. must be valid (no past events. mandatory)
*description - where the owner can tell more about the event.
*invite friends with facebook - the owner can invite his facebook friends that has installed the application 
								to the event.

tapping on the create button will publish the new event.

--Event Page--
Tapping on an event at the look around and what's next screen will open this page.
Information about the event will be shown, plus an "event wall" where the users can leave comments
about the event.
tapping on a user icon that is shown in "in the event" section will open his public profile.

--My Area--
from the navigation drawer, tapping on the user's name will open "My Area".
In this screen, there are three tabs:
*profile - where the info about the user is visible and can be edited.
*Invited to events - a list of events other users invited you to.
*my created events - a list of events the user has created. tapping on one will give him the option to 
   					 update or delete the event.
   					 

----   					 
We tried to make a wide application, using multiple tools and libraries such as facebook graph api for locations and profiles,
google location, parse, push notifications, gps usage and more...
We enjoyed the process and learned a bunch of tools that will surly help us in our
next application.
and just one more thing:
Thanks for the interesting and helpful course!

   					 
 Note about location:
 The application is a location based app.  
 Therefore, if there will be no GPS signal, the last location or default location will be chosen .
